# ABCs to Strong Passwords for Community.

## Background
Passwords are the only thing protecting the stuff you want to protect. But there are many passwords out there that are unsafe to use since it is easy to guess and break. So, I am here to help you find a strong password for every login website!

## Step 1.
Choose two of your favorite words.

This can be in any language, just in the pronunciation of English.

For example, I could choose `Tatakae` which means "fight!" in Japanese and `Bonjour` which means "good morning"/"hello" in french.

Also, if the word is in small letters, uppercase the first character to be your desired word.

e.g. `morning` -> `Morning`

## Step 2.
Choose the year where you felt most memorable or the most connection with.

This can be your favorite birthday year or even a year that something important happened.

For example, I could choose `1995` which is the year I was born.

## Step 3.
Choose one of your favorite symbols to use.

Here are a list of symbols you can use, `!@#$%^&*()-+;\"':{}[]\|,./<>?+_~`.

As an example, using `+` which would help with the complexity of your password.

## Step 4.
Now, create your password in the format described below.

The first thing should your word.

`Bonjour` and `Tatakae`

You can order them in any way. `BonjourTatakae` or `TatakaeBonjour`.

Next, your symbol and year. Reorder them in any order and combine them with your word.

e.g. the password can be
```
BonjourTatakae+1995
TatakaeBonjour1995+
so on...
```
